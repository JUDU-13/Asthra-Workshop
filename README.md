# üè† Interactive House Price Prediction Model

This project contains a simple, end-to-end machine learning model for predicting house prices. The entire workflow is captured in a single Jupyter Notebook (`Asthra_Workshop.ipynb`). 
The model is trained on a synthetically generated dataset and provides an interactive command-line interface for users to get price predictions for new houses based on their features.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Synthetic Data Generation**: Creates a realistic dataset of house features (size, bedrooms, age) and prices.
-   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Includes visualizations like histograms, pair plots, and a correlation heatmap to understand the data.
-   **Model Training**: Implements a Linear Regression model using `scikit-learn`.
-   **Performance Evaluation**: Measures the model's accuracy using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R¬≤) score.
-   **Interactive Prediction**: Allows users to input house features (size, bedrooms, age) and get an instant price prediction.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

-   Python
-   Pandas
-   NumPy
-   Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
-   Scikit-learn for machine learning
